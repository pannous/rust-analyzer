rust-analyzer is a language server that provides IDE functionality for
writing Rust programs.

This is a fork of the official repository adding functionality for our forked custom Rust language:

https://github.com/pannous/rust local /opt/other/rust

Here we mainly support its new syntax and some other quality of life features, Like running Rust files directly as a script.  

After adding a new feature, use ./install-plugin.sh which will also restart RustRover.
